A Home Assistant custom integration for deterministic irrigation scheduling — a
hass-free sequencer engine driving your valves, plus a bundled Lovelace timeline
card (`ha-irrigation-timeline-card`) delivered in the same install.

**Requires Home Assistant 2026.7.0 or newer** (setup fails with a clear error on
older versions).

## Installation (HACS custom repository)

1. In HACS, open **⋮ → Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/ic3rus/ha-irrigation-controller` with category
   **Integration**.
3. Install **HA Irrigation Controller**, then restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration** and search for
   *HA Irrigation Controller*.

The integration and the built card ship together — no separate card install.

## Development

The repo ships a devcontainer (Python 3.14 + Node 22). Open it in VS Code and
the `scripts/setup` post-create hook installs everything. Then:

```bash
scripts/develop
```

This starts a local Home Assistant instance (http://localhost:8123) with the
integration loaded **and** a Rollup watch that rebuilds the card bundle to
`custom_components/ha_irrigation_controller/frontend/` on change.

> **Note:** reloading the config entry does *not* pick up Python code changes —
> restart `scripts/develop` (full HA restart) after editing integration code.
> Card changes only need a browser hard-refresh.

Other loops:

```bash
scripts/lint                 # Ruff format + lint (autofix)
python3 -m pytest tests/     # backend + engine test suites
cd card && npm test          # card unit tests (vitest)
cd card && npm run build     # rebuild the committed card bundle
```

### Layout

```text
custom_components/ha_irrigation_controller/
  engine/     # hass-free scheduling core (imports NOTHING from homeassistant.*)
  adapters/   # HA <-> engine adapters
  entities/   # entity platforms
  frontend/   # BUILT card bundle (committed; shipped by HACS)
card/         # card TypeScript source (Lit 3 + Rollup + vitest)
tests/        # pytest-homeassistant-custom-component harness + engine tests
```

The built card bundle is committed on purpose: HACS installs
`custom_components/` as-is, so the card must live inside it (single-repo,
single-install design).

## CI

Every push and pull request runs hassfest, HACS validation, Ruff
(format + lint), pytest against HA **stable and beta**, and the card build +
vitest. A nightly cron re-runs validation and the test matrix to catch
Home Assistant's monthly breakage early.
